<h2 class="chapter">PREFACE</h2>


<p>A few years ago, the readers of
"Wee Willie Winkie" detected a new
vein running through the Editorial
Notes and announcements which prefaced
the monthly collection of juvenile
literary efforts, which made up their
little Magazine.</p>

<p>There was an originality and a
humour which they had not noticed before,
and Competitions were suggested
to them of a type for a repetition of
which they clamoured.</p>

<p>And then presently a new serial story
began, and the hairbreadth escapes of
that immortal Monkey which it recorded
were breathlessly followed by Wee Willie
Winkie's army of bairns all over the
world; and when it was concluded, so
numerous were the entreaties for a sequel,
that compulsion had to be resorted to
in order to secure the revelation of the
later life of the hero under a new name.</p>

<p>And now at last the Editors who were
responsible for the periodical referred to
have to make a confession.</p>

<p>Once upon a time they both, mother
and daughter, forsook their office and
went away to Canada for several months
in 1891, and during that time their joint
editorial chair was occupied by no other
than Professor Henry Drummond.</p>

<p>And now our readers will understand
to whom they are indebted for the
quaint sayings and funny stories and
Competitions betokening someone who
"understood" boys&mdash;and girls too.
And they will be grateful to a certain
contributor who failed to send his copy
in time for the monthly issue on one
occasion, and so forced the then Editor
to sit down and write "something." It
was the first time he had ever tried to
write fiction, and as the story grew under
his pen, he began to realise the joy of
creation. And so it was that, in spite
of his playful deprecation of "such nonsense"
being printed, the adventures of
"the Monkey that would not kill" came
to be told, and we know that we can do
our old friends and readers no greater
kindness than to dedicate these chronicles
to them in permanent form, in
memory of one to whom "Wee Willie"
and his bairns were ever a subject of
affectionate interest.</p>

<h2 class="chapter"><a name="monkey" id="monkey"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>


<p>There is no such thing as an immortal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
monkey, but this monkey was as near
it as possible. Talk of a cat's nine
lives&mdash;this monkey had ninety! A
monkey's business in the world is
usually to make everybody merry, but
the special mission of this one, I fear,
was to make everybody as angry as
ever they could be. In wrath-producing
power, in fact, this monkey
positively shone.</p>

<p>How many escapes the monkey had
before the run-away slave presented it
to the missionary&mdash;from whom I first
heard of it&mdash;no one knows. It certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
had not much hair on when it
arrived, and there was an ominous scar
on its head, and its ears were not
wholly symmetrical. But the children
were vastly delighted with it, and after
much kind treatment the creature was
restored to rude health, and, I must
confess, to quite too rude spirits. The
children wanted him baptized by the
time-honoured title of 'Jacko'; but
by a series of exploits in which the
monkey distinguished himself at the
expense of every member of the household
in turn, it became evident that
only one name would fit a quadruped
of his peculiar disposition; and that
was 'Tricky.' Tricky, therefore, he
was called, and as Tricky he lived
and&mdash;did <i>not</i> die.</p>

<div class="microspace">&nbsp;</div>
<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></div>
<div class="image border2" style="width: 317px; height: 551px;">

<span class="caption">TRICKY UPSET EVERYTHING</span>
</div>
<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></div>
<div class="microspace">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="nanospace">&nbsp;</div>

<p>There was no peace in the home<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
after Tricky came. He ate everything,
upset everything, broke everything,
stole everything, did everything
that the average monkey ought not
to do. If they shut him up in a room,
Tricky got out by the chimney. If
they put him out of the room, Tricky
came in by the chimney. What could
you do with such a creature? He
could not be kept in, and he could
not be kept out; so a court-martial
was held, and Tricky was sentenced
to be given away.</p>

<p>But by this time the whole place
knew Tricky, and no one would have
him. Such an unusual refusal of a
present was never known before. Even
the run-away slave smiled sweetly when
his old friend was offered to him, and
protested that, to his deep regret, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
was unable to buy nuts enough to
keep him.</p>

<p>The idea of 'wandering' Tricky in
the woods, of course, occurred to the
genius of the village, and a detachment
of boys set off one Saturday to carry
it into effect. But you might as well
have tried to wander a carrier pigeon.
Like Mary's little lamb, everywhere
these boys went, that monkey went.
When they ran, it ran, when they
doubled back, it doubled back; and
when they got home, dead tired, it was
only to find Tricky laughing at them
from the church roof.</p>

<p>That night the worst happened.
When the people assembled for the
weekly meeting, there was not found
in that church one whole hymn-book.
Some one, apparently, had been pelting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
the pulpit with them. The cushions
were torn; the blinds were a wreck;
two stops in the harmonium were pulled
out bodily. After the service the
missionary was solemnly waited on by a
deputation. They were closeted for an
hour and a half, but no one, except
themselves, ever knew what was said
or done. The only circumstances that
one could in any way connect with
this mysterious council was that about
midnight a small boat was seen stealthily
putting out to sea. It contained two
figures&mdash;one, who rowed, was the senior
elder; the other, who sat in the stern,
looked like a very small boy.</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">CHAPTER II</h2>


<p>The day was not yet broken when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
'watch' of the ship <i>Vulcan</i>, lying becalmed
off the &mdash;&mdash; coast, was roused
by a peculiar noise aft. Going to the
spot he was surprised to find a much-bedraggled
monkey rubbing itself on
a pile of sail-cloth. The creature had
evidently swum or drifted a long distance,
and was now endeavouring to
restore circulation. Jerry, being a
humane man, got it some biscuit, and
a saucer of grog, and waited developments.
These were not slow to show
themselves; within twenty-four hours
the commander of the ship <i>Vulcan</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
740 tons register, was a monkey named
Tricky.</p>

<p>Time would fail me to tell of the life
that monkey led them all on board
the <i>Vulcan</i>. After the first week only
two things lay between him and death
at any moment. One was his inventiveness.
Tricky's wickedness was
nothing, if not original. Every day
he was at some new villainy; and anything
<i>new</i> on board ship is sacred.
There is no <i>Punch</i> published on board
ship; but Tricky was all the comic
papers rolled into one. But that was
not the main reason. There is a good
deal of quiet quarrelling on board ship.
The mate spared Tricky because he
thought he would some day give the
Captain a 'turn'; the Captain let him
live, hoping he would do something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
dreadful to the mate. Everybody
waited to see Tricky do something
to somebody else. So he rose to the
highest rank in the merchant-marine,
and was respected almost to idolatry
by all on board the <i>Vulcan</i>.</p>

<p>One day Tricky was hanged&mdash;formally,
deliberately, and judicially
hanged. What had he done? He
had killed the ship cat. It was a
deliberate murder, with no extenuating
circumstances, and a rope, with a noose,
was swung over the yard-arm, and
Tricky run up in the presence of all the
crew. This happened about eight bells,
and at dusk Tricky was still hanging
there, very quiet and motionless. Next
morning Tricky was still there&mdash;as live
as you are. Tricky was not hanged,
he was only hanging; and, as everybody
knows, monkeys rather like
hanging. In fact, though Tricky was
still up there, he had got his hands
well round the rope, and was on the
whole fairly at home. The rope round
a neck like Tricky's was a mere
boa.</p>

<span class="caption">NEXT MORNING TRICKY WAS STILL THERE</span>
</div>
<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></div>
<div class="microspace">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="nanospace">&nbsp;</div>

<p>The executioners were rather ashamed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
of themselves when they saw how
matters stood; but instead of softening
them, this dangling mockery of a dead
monkey still further roused their wrath,
and the boatswain was told off to end
the drama by tossing Tricky into the
sea. The boatswain was up the shrouds
in a moment, and loosening the rope
with one hand, and catching the monkey
by the tail with the other, he swung
poor Tricky a good yard over the
ship's side into the Atlantic.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>When the boatswain descended upon
the deck he was greeted with a sudden
deluge of rain. It was only Tricky
shaking the salt-water off. The monkey
had climbed up the stern rope, and
reached the deck before him. What
would have happened next is hard to
predict, but at this point the Captain,
attracted by the scream of laughter
which greeted the drenching of the
boatswain, came up and was told the
sequel to the hanging. Now the
Captain was a blunt, good-natured
man, and he avowed that neither man
nor monkey who had ever been hanged
on board his ship should ever be put
to death again. This was the law on
shore, he said, and he would see fair-play.
So Tricky received another
lease of life, and thus the ship <i>Vulcan</i>
was kept in hot water for two months
more.</p>

<div class="microspace">&nbsp;</div>

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></div>
<div class="microspace">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="nanospace">&nbsp;</div>

<p>About the end of that period there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
came a crisis. The ship was nearing
port, and a heavy cleaning was in
progress. Among other things the
ship's boats had to be painted. In an
evil hour one of the men went below
to dinner, and left his paint-pot standing
on the deck. If Tricky had lost
such a chance he would not have been
a monkey at all. Needless to say he
rose to the occasion. That his supreme
hour was come was quite evident from
the way he set to work at once. He
began with the parrot, which he painted
vermilion; then he passed the brush
gaily along the newly varnished wood-work&mdash;daubed
the masts and shrouds
all over, obliterated the name on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
life-buoys, and wound up a somewhat
successful performance by emptying
the pot over the Captain's best coat,
which was laid in the sun to get the
creases out.</p>

<p>I draw a veil over what happened
on the <i>Vulcan</i> during the next quarter
of an hour. There was never such a
muster of the crew since they left port:
Everybody seemed to have business on
deck. When the Captain came up
you could have heard a pin drop. I
shall not repeat his language, nor try
to compare with anything earthly the
voice with which he ordered every
man below. All I will record is&mdash;and
it is to his everlasting honour&mdash;that
in that awful hour the Captain was
true to his vow. 'Do you see land?'
he roared to the steersman. 'Aye,
aye, sir,' said the man, 'land on the
larboard bow.' 'Then,' said the Captain,
'put her head to it.'</p>

<div class="microspace">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="nanospace">&nbsp;</div>


<p>That night, late, the ship stood close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
in to a small island on the north coast
of Scotland, and a boat was solemnly
sent ashore, and after that Tricky
was no more seen by any of the crew
of the <i>Vulcan</i>.</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">CHAPTER III</h2>


<p>The island on which the Captain of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
<i>Vulcan</i> exiled Tricky was marked on
the chart 'uninhabited.' But the chart
was wrong. Ten years before, a shepherd
had come there, and now lived
with his wife and family near the
top of the great sea-cliff. You may
judge of the sensation when a real live
monkey appeared in the early morning
in this remote and lonely spot. The
shepherd was watching his sheep when
the apparition rose, as it were, from
the ground. He had never seen
a monkey before, any more than
the sheep; and sheep and shepherd
bolted like wildfire. Tricky, of course,
followed the biped, for he had always
been accustomed to human society; and,
as the shepherd fled towards the hut,
he saw the monkey close at his heels.
So he made a rush at the open door,
and pulled it after him with a bang
which almost brought down the house.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">The fugitive had just got inside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
when, in a moment, he felt himself
seized from behind. It seemed as if
a powerful hand was dragging him
backward, and he threw himself down
on the ground, and roared with fear.
What had happened was that the flying
end of his plaid had got jammed in the
door, but he felt sure the evil spirit was
holding him in its clutches, and it was
some time before his startled wife could
convince him that there was nothing
there. The good woman gathered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
him up, and soothed him; and as soon
as he could speak he told her in a
shivering voice about the awful monster
which had come to slay them all. He
had scarcely got out the word 'monster,'
when there was a scurrying in the
chimney, and the monster presented
himself before them, and calmly sat
down on the meal-barrel. 'It's just
a puggy!' cried the shepherd's wife
(she had been to Inverness), and began
to stroke Tricky on the back. As
she did so, she noticed that the creature
had a strand of an old ship's rope round
its neck, and to this was attached a
small piece of paper. She opened it
and read four words, scrawled in a
hasty hand:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center">
<span class="smcap">'Won't Hang.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Won't Drown.'</span></span><br />
</div>

<p style="margin-top: 1.5em;">The shepherd seemed more frightened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
than ever at this revelation. 'Won't
hang, won't drown,' he muttered.
'Then, we'll see if it won't <i>shoot</i>,'
and he reached over the fireplace for
the gun which he killed the rabbits with.
As he loaded it it seemed to the shepherd's
wife as if all the powder and
shot in the house was being poured
into the barrel. She pleaded with her
husband to spare Tricky's life, and it
almost looked as if she had succeeded,
for the shepherd lowered the gun from
his shoulder and stood for a moment
as if in doubt. But it was not because
of his wife he stopped. It was partly
because he was quite too shaky to aim
straight; and partly because he was
too much of a sportsman to shoot offhand
a thing which was sitting quiet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
and still on his own meal-barrel; but
the main reason was that he was afraid
to shoot the baby, whose crib was just
beside it. So he gave the meal-barrel
a kick with his foot to dislodge the
monkey. He thought it would make for
the door, and there, in the open air,
he would shoot it fair and square.</p>

<p>But the monkey had other views.
What it wanted was something to eat;
and the children's porridge being handy,
it put its paw in and began breakfast.
The shepherd was too much petrified
to interfere, and it was only when
Tricky next spilt the milk-jug over
the baby that he roused himself to do
his duty to his family. He raised the
gun once more, and, watching his chance
when Tricky was exactly opposite the
door, aimed straight at its heart, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
pulled the trigger. Now, the next
moment that monkey ought to have
been scattered all over the hillside in
multitudinous fragments. On the contrary,
it was up on the table, imitating
the click of the gun with a spoon.
Not that the shepherd missed. For
the first time in its life the rusty lock
had 'struck,' and the dazed shepherd
was more than ever confirmed in his
belief that the monkey was a witch.</p>

<p>'Won't shoot,' he muttered to himself,
'won't hang, won't drown. I
have tried the first; I'll prove the
next.' So, as he was too superstitious
to try to shoot it again, he went out
to hang the monkey.</p>

<p>But there was no tree on the island.
All day the shepherd searched for a
place to hang Tricky, but in vain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
That night he lay thinking, hour after
hour, where he would hang it, and in
the early morning an inspiration came
to him&mdash;he would try the pump! So
he rose softly and fixed the handle of
the pump high in the air, so that it
stuck out like a gallows, and tied a
rope with a noose to the end of it.
Then he got Tricky to perch on the
top of the pump, tied the rope round
his neck, and all was ready. The
shepherd had heard that the object
of hanging was to break the neck of
the criminal by a sudden 'drop,' but
as he could not give Tricky a long
enough drop he determined to make
up for it in another way. So he
gathered all his strength, and with
a tremendous sweep of his arms sent
Tricky flying into space. Of course
you know what happened. The rope&mdash;it
was quite rotten&mdash;broke, and
Tricky landed on his four paws, and
stood grinning at his executioner, as
if he would like it all over again.</p>

<p>That whole day the sheep and lambs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
on the Island of &mdash;&mdash; were neglected.
All day long you might have seen
the shepherd sitting by the marsh-side
plaiting something with his fingers.
Round him, the ground was strewn
with rushes, some loose, and some in
bundles, but for every one the workman
chose he threw away a hundred,
because it was not tough and strong.
And as he plaited, and twisted, and
knotted, and tested, there was fire in
the shepherd's eye, and thunder all
over his face.</p>

<p>At daybreak next morning the shep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>herd
and the monkey once more formed
in procession and wended their way to
the old pump. The new rope could
hang an elephant. It was thick as a
boa-constrictor, and the shepherd took
a full hour to adjust the noose and get
the gallows into working order. Then
the fatal moment came. With a
mightier shove than before the monkey
was launched into the air, and the rope
stiffened and held like a ship's hawser.
But the executioner had not calculated
everything. The rope and the 'drop'
were all right, but when the gallows
felt the shock, the pump-handle cracked
off like a match, and the old moss-covered
tube gave two rocks and reeled
from its moorings, and lay split in
pieces on the ground. Jagged and
needlelike splinters at the same moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
scraped and pierced and gouged at the
shepherd's shins, and tore his nether
garments, and made him dance with
pain and rage. If anything could have
added more agony to the next few
minutes it was the sight of Tricky.
That ever gay animal was careering
down the hill straight towards the
feeding sheep. The pump-handle was
still tied to its neck, and it clattered
over the stones with a noise weird
enough to drive the whole flock into
the sea. The shepherd knew there
must be a catastrophe, but he was
powerless to avert it. He was too sore
to follow, so he slowly limped towards
the hut, to nurse his wrath and his
wounds.</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">CHAPTER IV</h2>


<p>For three days after the monkey had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
been 'hanged' it did not come near
the shepherd or his house. A monkey
has feelings. To be nearly hanged is
bad enough, but to have a boa-constrictor
and a pump-handle tied to
your neck is more than any self-respecting
animal would stand. So
Tricky devoted himself exclusively to
the sheep. For the space of three
days, with the invaluable aid of the
pump-handle, Tricky shepherded that
flock. Not a blade of grass was nibbled
during this period; one prolonged
stampede was kept up night and day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
The lambs dropped with hunger. The
old sheep tottered with fatigue. The
whole flock was demoralised. In fact,
when the 'Reign of Terror' closed
there was not a pound of sound mutton
left on the island.</p>

<p>Why did not the shepherd interfere?
Because, as we shall see, for these three
days he had more urgent work to do.
When the shepherd's wife went out to
the pump that morning for water to
make the porridge with, she found it
a heap of ruins. She came back and
broke the tidings to the shepherd, and
said she believed it had been struck
with lightning. The shepherd discreetly
said nothing, but presently stole
sullenly out to inspect the damage once
more. It was worse than he thought.
A pump must hold in both air and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
water; this pump was rent and split
in a dozen places. There was no water
either to drink or make the porridge
with, till the tube was mended. So
all that day the shepherd was splicing,
and hammering, and gluing, and
bandaging. All the next day he was
doing the same. He got nothing to
eat or drink; nobody got anything to
eat or drink. The poor children were
kept alive on a single bowlful, which
happened to be in the house, but this
was now finished, and they were crying
out from want. Positively, if this
drought and famine had been kept up
for a few days more the island would
certainly have been restored to the
condition described on the chart&mdash;'uninhabited.'</p>

<p>On the morning of the fourth day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
the pump stood erect, and wind and
water-tight once more. Only one
thing was wanting&mdash;there was no
handle. The only thing left was to
try to catch Tricky, for there was
nothing else on the island which would
make a handle. But just then Tricky
required no catching. At that moment
he was sitting on the doorstep contemplating
the group round the pump.
Everybody being out, he had seized
the opportunity to have a good breakfast&mdash;consisting
of every particle of
meal in the barrel&mdash;and was now
enjoying a period of repose before
recommencing hostilities. The shepherd
made a rush at him, but, alas,
what he wanted was no longer there.
A piece of frayed rope dangled on its
neck, but the pump-handle was gone.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>It took two days more to find it.
Every inch of the island was patiently
examined. Even the child next the
baby had to join in the search. Night
and day they were all at it; and at last
it was found by the shepherd's wife&mdash;stuck
in a rabbit-hole. All this time
no one had leisure to kill Tricky.
But on the seventh day the shepherd
rose with murder written on his brow.
The monkey would not shoot, and he
would not hang; it remained to try
what drowning would do. So he tied
a large stone round the monkey's neck,
and led him forth to the edge of the
great sea-cliff.</p>

<div class="microspace">&nbsp;</div>

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></div>
<div class="microspace">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="nanospace">&nbsp;</div>

<p>A hundred feet below, the sea lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
like a mirror; and the shepherd, as he
looked over for a deep place, saw the
great fronds of the sea-weeds and the
jelly-fish and the anemones lying motionless
in the crystal waters. Then he
took the monkey and the stone in his
great hands, examined the knots hastily,
and, with one sudden swing, heaved
them over the cliff.</p>

<p>The shepherd would much rather
at this point have retired from the
scene. But he dared not. He could
not trust that monkey. An actual
certificate of death was due to himself
and to his family. So he peered over
the cliff and saw the splash in the sea,
and watched the ripples clearing off
till the sea-bottom stood out again with
every shell distinct. And there, sure
enough, was Tricky, down among the
star-fish, safely moored to his gravestone,
and the yard of good rope holding
like a chain-cable. The shepherd rose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
for the first time since that monkey set
foot upon the island and breathed
freely. Then he slowly went back to
the house and told the tale of the end
of Tricky.</p>

<p>It was not till midnight that Tricky
came back. Of course you knew
Tricky would come back. You knew
the rope would slip over the stone,
or break, or be eaten through by a
great fish, or something, and, though
none of these things happened, it is
certainly true that that night at midnight
Tricky did turn up. Perhaps I
should say turn down, for he came in,
as usual, by the chimney. But the
exact way in which this singular creature
escaped from its watery grave must be
reserved for another chapter.</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">CHAPTER V</h2>


<p>If the shepherd had stood looking over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
the cliff for one moment longer he
would have witnessed a curious scene.
Every schoolboy knows that a stone
is lighter in water than in air. How
the monkey knew this, or whether he
did or did not, it is impossible to say,
but his actions were certainly those
of a philosopher. For, instead of
resigning himself to his fate, he bent
down and grasped the stone which
held him to his watery grave, picked
it up in his arms, and walked calmly
along the bottom towards the shore.
With a supreme effort he next got the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
stone edged on to a half-submerged
ledge; but now that it was half out
of the water it was once more too
heavy to lift, and Tricky lay in great
perplexity in the shallow water, wondering
how ever he was to get out of
this fresh dilemma. There appeared
nothing for it but to attack the rope
with his teeth, and for an hour Tricky
worked at the tough strands, but without
almost any success. After another
hour's work the monkey made an
appalling discovery. When he began
work, the water was only up to his
knees; and to his consternation, it now
covered him up to his middle. In a
short time more it came up to his neck,
and it was clear to Tricky that if the
ledge went on sinking at this rate he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>was a dead monkey. Tricky thought
he knew all about the sea, but in the
foreign sea, where he had lived with
the missionary, there were no tides, and
this creeping in of the water greatly
disturbed his peace of mind. To his
great joy, however, he found that the
stone, now wholly covered with water,
was once more light enough to lift,
and he trundled it along the ledge till
the water became too shallow to move
it further. Just above this point was
another ledge, high and dry above
tide-mark, and the yard of rope was
just long enough to allow the monkey
to take up his position there, and shake
himself dry in the sun.</p>

<p>Now, this shaking process suggested
an idea to Tricky&mdash;a very obvious one
to you or me, but a real inspiration to
a monkey. Tricky noticed that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
very part of the rope where he had
been gnawing rested against the sharp
edge of the rocky ledge, and that one
frayed strand had suddenly parted while
he was shaking himself. The rock-edge,
in fact, was a regular knife, and
after much and hard rubbing, and many
rests, Tricky found himself within three
or four strands of freedom. It was
all but midnight when the last strand
parted, and in a few minutes more the
gallant monkey crawled up the cliff
and stood once more at the door of
his executioner's house.</p>

<p>I am afraid you will be as much surprised
as Tricky was at the startling
discovery he made when he got there.
The cottage was on fire! For days,
you will remember, there had been
no food in the shepherd's home. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
that day the family had celebrated the
mending of the pump by a great banquet
and a washing. Such a fire was
lit as had not blazed on the hearth
for years, and when it grew dark
the red sparks flew into the air and
fell in dangerous showers upon the
dry thatched roof. The wind, too,
rose about nightfall, and fanned one
smouldering square of turf into life; and
when Tricky reached the spot at least
half the roof was already in a blaze.
But Tricky was hungry after his day's
adventures, and the chimney end of
the roof being still untouched by the
fire, he jumped on to the roof and down
into the kitchen with a bound. The
baby's cradle lay, as usual, close to the
side of the fire, and the monkey, in
passing, must have swished it with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
his tail, for the infant broke into a
sudden yell, which rang through the
room, and woke the shepherd with a
start. The good man was awake not
a moment too soon. Had the monkey
arrived five minutes later the whole
family must have perished; the smoke
had already filled the other room, and
was pouring in, in rolling clouds, below
the kitchen door. With one thunderstruck
glare at the night-watchman who
had wakened him so opportunely&mdash;and
who now occupied his usual throne on
the meal-barrel, violently sneezing out
smoke, and wondering whether it was
not better to be drowned&mdash;the shepherd
rushed towards the door to save the
two elder children who lay locked in
slumber in the burning room beyond.
Seizing them in his arms, he bore them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
safely to the open air, and then returned
for his wife and the other children.
Tricky followed at their heels; and the
next moment the rescued family stood
in a shivering group, helplessly watching
the flames. The roof soon fell in, and
in the morning all that remained of the
shepherd's house was a few charred
rafters.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>On the spot where the shepherd's
cottage was burned now stands a noble
lighthouse. It was put up a few months
after the fire, and one of the three lighthouse-keepers
is the shepherd. The
second is a man who is fond of telling
tales of the sea, and how he was once
mate of a ship called the <i>Vulcan</i>. The
third keeper of the lighthouse is a
quadruped called Tricky. The affec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>tion
between him and the ex-shepherd
is peculiar. Other people think there
is some history connected with it, but
the shepherd never says much. When
asked if it is really true that the
monkey cannot be killed, he always
replies, 'Yes; but that is not why it
is alive.' Only on one occasion was
the shepherd known to add anything
to that remark. It was one night when
Tricky had held back the baby&mdash;it had
just learned to creep&mdash;from tumbling
over the cliff. Then the shepherd
smiled as he threw Tricky a whole
bagful of nuts, and said, 'That monkey
won't kill&mdash;nor let anybody else kill.'</p>

<p>I suppose you thought the monkey I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
told you about before was dead. But
my opinion is that he is still alive. At
least, I am pretty sure it is the same
monkey that I have now to tell you
about, though I cannot be quite sure.
In the first place this new monkey was
very like Tricky, and in the second
place it was a monkey that <i>would not
kill</i>. Now, I never heard before of
any monkey that would not kill except
one, and that was Tricky.</p>

<p>Another thing that makes me think
it is the same monkey, is that Tricky
disappeared from the island where we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
saw him last. No one knows how it
happened, but there was a coincidence
about the time which I must relate.
One morning a boat's crew landed on
the island where Tricky lived with
the lighthouse-keeper, to fill their
water-kegs. The lighthouse-keeper
was kind to them, for they were
foreigners, and showed them all over
the lighthouse, and when they got to
the very top they found the monkey
dusting the lamps just like a human
being. The sailors were much astonished,
and one of them, who could
speak a little English, wanted to buy
Tricky for two pounds. When the
lighthouse-keeper heard this he was
very angry, and ordered them all down
the ladder. This made the men angry
in turn, for they did not know the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
reason why the lighthouse-keeper loved
the monkey, and they told him they
would not forget the way he had
insulted them. Of course he had not
insulted them at all, but foreign sailors
are sometimes quick-tempered, and
these men came from a country where
slights are easily felt. The sailors
spent the whole day on shore, as the
wind was unfavourable for getting out
to sea, but no one saw them enter the
lighthouse again. Next morning, all
that the lighthouse-keeper saw of the
sailors and their ship was the tips of
their top-gallants dipping over the
horizon edge. And all that he saw of
the monkey that&mdash;would&mdash;not&mdash;kill,
after searching night and day for a
week was&mdash;nothing.</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">CHAPTER II</h2>


<p>Mr. Donald MacAlsh, gold-miner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
from Silver Creek, California, happening
to be in San Francisco, read one morning
the following paragraph in the <i>San
Francisco Herald</i>:&mdash;</p>


<div class="blockquote">'<span class="smcap">Curious Tale of The Sea.</span>&mdash;Captain
J. E. Dawkins of the <i>Mermaid</i>, which has
just arrived in this port from Liverpool,
reports a singular occurrence. About ten
days' out from home the look-out observed
what he took to be a great sea-serpent, but
which, on further inspection, turned out to
be a quantity of wreckage. On approaching
the spot the figure of a boy was distinctly
observed clinging to the broken portion of a
mast, and obviously still alive. A small
boat was instantly lowered, the ship's crew
meantime making signals to the boy to
inform him that he was being rescued.
After a suspense of some half-hour the boat
returned with the extraordinary intelligence
that the figure seen was not that of a boy,
but of a monkey. Search among the
wreckage for human remains proved unavailing,
and it is feared that a serious
catastrophe has occurred. The only clue to
the nationality of the vessel, which, it is
only too plain, has met with a disastrous
fate, are the letters "vorni" on a portion of
what had evidently formed the bow of one
of the life-boats. Possibly these letters are
part of "Livorni," the Italian word for Leghorn,
and the list of recent sailings from
that port is now being scrutinised with some
anxiety.'</div>

<p>Now what interested Donald&mdash;'Big<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
Donald,' he was always called&mdash;in this
story was not the monkey, but the
arrival of the <i>Mermaid</i>. For the
Captain was a friend of his, and was
bringing him some tools from home in
this very ship. Though 'Big Donald'
was now a gold-miner, he came out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
from Scotland when quite a lad. His
father was a small farmer in Skye, and,
dying early, the family emigrated to
America. As it was to get these tools
that Donald came in to San Francisco
he soon found his way to the harbour,
and, finding out the <i>Mermaid</i>, walked
on board. No one was visible on deck,
so Donald sat down on a coil of rope
to wait. He had not been there three
minutes when a matted head and two
very brilliant eyes suddenly shot up the
companion, and a full-grown monkey
sprang in front of him and stared into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
his face. Donald, much startled by
this apparition, called out in a loud
voice for the creature to go away; but
the moment the words were spoken the
monkey sprang on his back and clasped
its long hairy arms about his neck.
The miner shook it off in terror and
tried to run ashore, but the monkey
followed, frisking and gambolling round
him, and chasing him all over the quay.
Donald soon discovered, however, that
the monkey meant no harm, and a few
days later an explanation of this sudden
outburst of interest in a stranger&mdash;the
Captain told Donald that the monkey
had never been known to behave like
this before&mdash;broke in upon the miner's
mind. He remembered that when he
suddenly spoke to the monkey he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>called to it <i>in Gaelic</i>. Under the
impulse of a sudden fear, I suppose, the
language of his boyhood had started to
his lips, and the words came out unconsciously
'<i>Imich air falbh</i>,' which means
'Go away.' What made Donald remember
the circumstance was this, that
whenever afterwards he used the Highland
tongue the monkey manifested
peculiar signs of joy. The only way
the miner could account for this
singular fact was to suppose that somehow
or other this monkey had once
belonged to some one who used the
Gaelic language&mdash;a suggestion, however,
which people generally laughed
at. The miner always maintained,
nevertheless, that the monkey really
knew Gaelic, and he seldom spoke
to it in any other language. Of
course, people said this was simply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
to show off that he knew two
languages.</p>

<p>I do not know whether the miner
bought the monkey, or whether the
Captain gave it to him, or whether it
ran away, but it is certain that from
this hour it belonged to Donald.
When he left the ship with his tools,
the monkey followed, trotting after him
like a dog all the way till he reached
his lodgings. The miner then went
into the house and shut the door,
leaving the monkey outside. In ten
minutes it seemed as if all the boys in
San Francisco had gathered in that
street. They formed a crowd round
the door which almost stopped the
traffic; and when the policeman shortly
appeared he was rather disgusted to
find that it was only a monkey perform<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>ing
gymnastic exercises on a door-knocker.
Roughly ringing the bell, he
ordered Donald to take in his monkey.
Donald replied meekly that he was not
responsible for the monkey, but the
officer said he would be summoned
for 'obstructing the thoroughfare and
causing a breach of the peace' if he
did not take in his guest at once. So
Donald had to submit, for he saw there
would be no rest in San Francisco till
this wayward creature had its will and
was safe inside. That night Donald
had a serious talk with the monkey as
it sat upright in its chair at supper.
He told it that if it would behave itself
he would take it up to the Rocky
Mountains to the gold diggings. The
monkey seemed to understand, for it
put down a lump of cheese it was about
to eat, skipped off its chair, and nestled
against Big Donald's side. Only one
other thing happened that night:
Donald gave the monkey its name.
He called it 'Gum'&mdash;because it stuck
to him.</p>

<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">CHAPTER III</h2>


<p>Next morning Donald and Gum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
started from San Francisco by an early
train on their way to Silver Creek.
The appearance of the monkey in the
railway carriage created much amusement
among the passengers, and
Donald had to stand a running-fire of
questions as to whether it belonged to
his great-grandfather or to a barrel-organ.
The fun was stopped in a little
while by the entrance of the conductor,
who demanded Gum's ticket. Gum
not having a ticket, an angry discussion
arose on the subject of fare; but
Donald said he would only pay when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
the conductor showed him the correct
price for a monkey printed in black and
white in the official books. There
being no special mention in these
volumes of monkeys on tour, Donald
declined to pay a cent, and the
conductor departed, vowing he would
put Gum out of the train at the next
station. When the next station came,
however, Donald and the monkey were
entrenched in a corner, the latter
tightly grasped in the miner's great
arms, and the conductor, after a glance
at the situation, decided to wait for a
more convenient season. In America
the conductor, instead of entering the
carriages only when the train stops,
moves about all the time from one
carriage to another, so that as the
station for Silver Creek was still eleven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
hours' distant, he had little doubt his
chance would come.</p>

<div class="microspace">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="microspace">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="nanospace">&nbsp;</div>

<p>And come it did. It was a piping
hot day, even for California, and late
in the afternoon Donald fell asleep.
His arms were still clasped round the
monkey, and the conductor would
never have succeeded in his object but
for an accident. It happened that
about that time the train was approaching
an important junction, and part of
every ticket had to be given up at that
point. In America a railway ticket is
sometimes half a yard in length, and
pieces have to be torn off from point
to point. To avoid the disturbance
caused by this operation, miners, cowboys,
and others are in the habit of
wearing their tickets slipped into the
band of their great wide-awake hats,
and Donald was in this inviting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
position when the conductor came
round. He snatched it out of the hat
to tear off the necessary piece, when
the monkey, thinking a theft was
meant, sprang at the man and buried
his teeth in his wrist. Roaring with
pain, the conductor seized his assailant
by the throat, and, before Donald could
come to the rescue, tossed him out of
the window. The train was dashing
round a curve at thirty miles an hour,
and when Donald stretched out his
neck to find out whether Gum was
killed, it was with small hope of ever
seeing him more. For two minutes the
miner gazed at the receding distance,
then, without uttering a word, turned
round and felled the conductor to the
floor.</p>






<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">CHAPTER IV</h2>


<p>When the train rolled into the junction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
about an hour after, Donald went into
the refreshment room to quiet his
nerves with a cup of cocoa. He was
about to take his seat again in the
carriage when he observed a crowd on
the platform opposite the brake-van at
the rear end of the train. Making his
way to the spot and looking over the
heads of the crowd, what was his
amazement to see Gum seated on the
coupling apparatus, and looking about
him with perfect serenity. One hand
held an iron rod, and with the other he
scratched his head; and, but for a great
splash of brown earth on one side, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
monkey seemed wholly untouched by
his adventure. A single word in
Gaelic from Donald made the monkey
spring from its perch, and over the
heads of the people into his arms, and
in a few minutes the strange friends
were pursuing their journey again, as
if nothing had happened. A new
conductor was now on the train, and
Donald made friends with him by
reciting the whole adventure, so that
they were allowed to end the day in
peace. About midnight the two got
out at a roadside station, where they
spent the night, and in the grey of the
morning set out by coach for Silver
Creek. From Silver Creek Donald's
cabin was still thirty miles' walk over
the mountains, and after another day's
hard toiling they reached the spot.</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">CHAPTER V</h2>


<p>After a long journey over the mountains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
Donald reached his log cabin on
the Silver Creek. The monkey, however,
did not find quite so immediate a
welcome as himself from Donald's wife.
The only pet her children had ever
seen before was a baby puma, which the
miner had picked out of the stream one
day in a half-drowned state. Donald
had mistaken it for a kitten of some
new brand, and it was not until some
weeks later, when it sprang upon his
little girl and buried his claws in her
neck, that he realised what sort of
plaything&mdash;the puma is the lion of
the Rocky Mountains&mdash;he had intro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>duced
into his family. So Donald's
wife was suspicious of pets, and when
she saw the monkey she was sure it was
another lion, and would not allow it to
enter the door. But Gum had other
ways of entering houses than by doors,
and finally he was received as a lawful
member of the family, for the simple
reason that he could not be kept out.
The new guest gave little trouble.
Most of the day the monkey spent with
Donald at the mine. He went off with
him when he went to work in the morning,
and gambolled round him till he
came home for supper. And very soon
an incident happened which more than
reconciled Donald's wife to her strange
visitor. Donald's gold-mine was a poor
one. He had to work very hard to get
enough of the precious dust to keep his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
family in food, but his spirits were kept
up by the constant hope that he would
strike a richer bed and make his fortune.
The way he got the gold was to take
the sand and gravel from the banks of
the river and wash it about in a pan till
all the lighter particles passed off with
the water, leaving the little spangles of
gold at the bottom. Sometimes a week
would pass without the miner getting
more than a thimbleful, but occasionally
he would find a few lumps as big as a
pea. One day, however, just as Donald
was getting discouraged, a piece of great
good-luck befell him. He had been
particularly depressed that day, for no
gold at all had rewarded his search for
a week, and the family were already in
debt for flour and clothes. But, thanks
to the monkey, he was able to go home
to his wife with the largest gold nugget
that had been seen in that valley for
many years. Gum had been skirmishing
about as usual on the gravel
heaps, when some loose pebbles were
dislodged by his paws, and, as they
rolled down, he must have been attracted
by the yellow glitter in one
large lump, for the next moment he had
picked up the nugget and laid it, with a
wag of his tail, at Donald's feet. The
miner almost wept for gladness, and,
taking Gum up in his arms as if he were
a child, hurried home to proclaim his
fortune. That night the family had a
great feast, and Gum's health was drunk
in the strongest tea the mining camp
could furnish. Perhaps if they had
known what was shortly to happen they
would not have slept quite so soundly.</p>

<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">CHAPTER VI</h2>


<p>Two nights after the wheel of fortune<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
gave an unlooked-for turn. Donald's
wife was so proud of the nugget that
she could not keep the news to herself,
and, next morning, although Donald
had carefully told her to keep it quiet,
confided his good-luck to another
miner's wife, who lived a few hundred
yards off. This worthy woman told
another, and in twenty-four hours the
fame of Donald's nugget was spread
from end to end of the valley. This
would not have mattered in most places,
but mining districts are peopled by
criminals and adventurers of all kinds,
and among these were some lawless
characters whose chief business was to
get gold in some other way than by
working for it. Two of these men,
brothers, who lived with their families
at the lower end of the valley, determined
that they should possess themselves
of Donald's nugget. Covering
their faces with black masks, and armed
with revolvers, they set off about midnight
for the miner's cabin. The family
were fast asleep, and the robbers noiselessly
pushed up the window, and
entered the room where Donald slept.
Pointing a loaded revolver at his head,
one of the men roughly awoke him, and
told him if he moved or cried out he
would blow out his brains and murder
every one in the house. Donald was
too familiar with stories of camp crime
to resist an attack so sudden, and,
though a loaded revolver was under his
own pillow, he saw his disadvantage
and, for the sake of his wife and children,
controlled himself with a great
effort.</p>

<div class="microspace">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="nanospace">&nbsp;</div>

<div><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></div>
<p>'I want that little bit of metal of
yours,' said the robber. Donald lay
perfectly quiet. 'Do you hear!' exclaimed
the man, 'I want that gold.'</p>

<p>'Then you won't get it,' said Donald
quietly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>'I believe he has sent it to the bank,'
whispered the other man. 'Kill him if
he has.'</p>

<p>'Look here!' thundered the first, 'do
you mean to say that nugget is gone?'</p>

<p>Donald made no reply. If he
said it was gone, the robbers would
have simply sneaked home, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
Donald was known in these parts as a
man who never told a lie. Once more
the robber asked him, but Donald
remained silent. This was enough. If
it had really been gone Donald would
have certainly said so. So, while the
first man stood with a revolver at his
ear, the second proceeded to search the
house. Drawers, boxes, and cupboards
were opened and ransacked in quick
succession; every corner of the two
rooms was examined; the very dishes
on the shelf were turned upside down,
and the sugar-basin smashed to pieces
with a blow, in case it should have been
hidden there.</p>

<p>'Let me try,' said the man with the
revolver; 'you watch the old bear, and
see if I can't find it.'</p>

<p>Once more the house was ransacked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
from top to bottom, and the robber was
about to abandon the search, when a
sudden thought occurred to him. On
the mantel-piece ticked a wooden
American clock, about two feet high.
The man opened the door in the case,
and fumbled about with his finger.
Next moment he had drawn out the
nugget. He bent over the fire to get a
better look at it, and then proceeded to
weigh it in the palm of his hand, to see
how much it was worth. The other
robber, unable to restrain his curiosity,
moved likewise toward the fire, when
the first checked him with an angry cry,
and sent him back to his victim's side
to continue his guard. Another moment,
and Donald would have had his
revolver out, and the nugget would have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>been saved. But there was another
spectator of this scene on whom the
thieves had scarcely reckoned. In his
usual berth, crouched at the side of the
fireplace, sat Gum. The robber was
weighing the gold in his hand, turning
it round and round, and gloating over
it, when the glitter from the precious
metal attracted the monkey's eye. It
seemed to feel some sense of property
in this gold, for, quick as lightning, one
hairy paw brushed the robber's hand,
and the next moment the nugget was
gone. With a great oath the robber
turned on Gum, and dealt it a blow on
the head which knocked it senseless to
the other side of the room. But, before
that blow fell, two things happened.
With one hand held out to protect itself
against this sudden onslaught, the monkey
made a grab at its assailant's face,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
and tore off the black mask, so that
Donald instantly recognised the man,
in the glow of the firelight; with the
other hand, which held the gold, the
monkey swiftly transferred the nugget
to its mouth.</p>

<p>The robber's eye followed this last
movement, however, and he picked up
Gum roughly, and proceeded to wrench
open its jaws. He felt all round his
mouth, but the nugget was not there.
He held the senseless body up by the
tail and shook it, but no gold appeared.
He took his head between his knees,
and sounded all over its throat, but the
nugget was not to be found. As a
matter of fact it was not there. The blow
which had fallen upon the monkey's
head had knocked it down its throat.
Gum had swallowed the nugget!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>What was to be done now? If the
robber had had a knife in his pocket,
Gum would have been a dead monkey
in two seconds. But while he was
unsuccessfully feeling for his knife, Gum
suddenly came to, and with one violent
wriggle shook itself free, and sprang on
the highest shelf. The robber gave
chase; then followed the most comical
hunt you ever saw. The robber's face
being now exposed (he had no idea that
Donald had already recognised him), he
was afraid to turn round, and he had to
keep up the hunt without once facing in
the direction where Donald lay, with
the result that he was fairly baffled, and
after a quarter of an hour's hard work,
gave up the chase. All that remained
now was to blind Donald. Roughly
approaching the bed, the robber drew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
the blankets over Donald's face, and
told him he would shoot him if he dared
to stir. As an extra precaution, the
miner's revolver was taken out of reach,
and then both men started, with a piece
of rope, to secure the monkey. Clever
as Gum was, he was scarcely a match for
two men, who, as noted horse-thieves,
were experts in the use of the lasso, and
in a short time the monkey was ignominiously
driven from his perch on a rafter,
tied up in Donald's pillow-case, and
swung over the shoulder of one of the
men. Then the robbers wished Donald
a grim good-night, and marched off with
their 'purse.' As they were going out
of the door Donald called after them,
'Good-night, ye blackguards, and mark
my words, if ye lay a hand on that monkey
ye'll regret it as long as ye live!'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
This made the men a little frightened,
for although they did not like to confess
it to one another, there was something
about Gum that was 'not canny.' Anyhow,
whether it was fear of the monkey,
or of their own consciences, instead of
killing Gum as soon as they left the
house they carried it all the way home
with them, discussing which of them
was to kill it, and how it was to be done.</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">CHAPTER VII</h2>


<p>When the thieves reached home, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
a hasty breakfast, they continued the
discussion as to how the purse was to
be opened and the nugget secured.
Unfortunately for them the monkey had
struggled out of the pillow-case, as soon
as it reached the house, and the robbers'
children at once seized upon it, and
claimed it as their pet. When they
were told it would have to be killed, the
youngest child, a little girl so lovely that
even a bad father could not help loving
her, burst into tears, and, putting her
arms round the robber's neck, prayed and
entreated him to spare its life, and let her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
play with it. Now, wicked as this man
was, this child had a mysterious influence
over him, and though he was resolved
to kill Gum, and that immediately, he
determined that she should not see it
done, nor even know that he had done it.
Besides this, it would never do to let
the people in the valley know that they
had killed the monkey, for Donald
would surely go in search of it; so
after consulting together for some
time, the robbers decided on a plan
for killing Gum without anybody being
any the wiser. They knew that if
they shot it, or drowned it, or slew it
with a knife, the children would be
angry, and the story would certainly be
told to their playmates and passed on
in time to Donald's family. So a very
diabolical scheme was hatched. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
only way they could think of for killing
Gum without any one seeing, or without
either of them being actually present
at the death, was to <i>blow it up with gunpowder</i>.
This method had another advantage,
which neither of the men liked
to confess weighed with them, but in
reality it was this more than anything
else that made them think of the gunpowder.
At the bottom of their hearts
these men were cowards, and after the
strange threat which Donald had uttered
as they were leaving his house, they were
secretly afraid 'to lay a hand' upon Gum.
A monkey was a very mysterious creature.
They had never had anything to
do with one before. Gum's face had a
curious human look, and to murder it in
cold blood was almost like murdering a
man. So the gunpowder idea seemed the
very solution that was needed, and they
set about their preparations at once.
While one of the men remained at the
kitchen fire with the family to allay
suspicion, the other, after pocketing a
little can of miners' blasting-powder, a
couple of feet of fuse, and a piece of string,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103-105" id="Page_103-105">[103-105]</a></span>
strolled out to the wood behind the cabin
on the pretence of giving the monkey
a walk. As soon as a low thicket
screened the pair from view, the robber
tied the monkey to the trunk of a tree.
Then he lashed the can of gunpowder
tightly to the monkey's tail, passed one
end of the fuse into it through a small
hole, struck a match, and lighted the
other end. As soon as he saw the fuse
was fairly lit, and the red fire slowly
creeping upwards, he ran back as fast
as he could to the house. Meantime<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
the other man had got a concertina from
the shelf, and was playing with all his
might to drown the sound of the explosion.
When the executioner arrived,
out of breath though he was, he joined
noisily in the dance which the children
had set up the moment the concertina
began to play, and presently such
a stamping and shouting was going
on in the cottage that the sound of an
earthquake would have been quenched.
Suddenly an awful interruption occurred.
Through the open door the monkey
bounded in, and taking up its place in
the midst of the circle joined in the
dance. From its neck dangled a piece
of string, burnt at the point; but what
made the children shriek with laughter
was a small tin can tied to its tail, which
clattered about with every turn of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
body, and strange to say, had a sort of
little tail of its own which appeared to
be on fire, for little puffs of smoke were
coming from it, and a red colour glowed
at the tip. The moment the robbers
caught sight of this apparition there was
a yell of fear which paralysed the children
into rigid statues. The men's faces
were livid with terror, and some seconds
passed before either had recovered his
senses sufficiently to act. Then one man,
with a great sweep of his arms, caught up
all the children into one tumble bunch,
and flung them screaming with pain and
surprise under the bed of the adjoining
room. The other, who was directly responsible
for the mischief, seeing that the
only chance to save his house and himself
was to get Gum outside, clutched the
smoking monkey in his arms and rushed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
to the door. Quick as the movement
was, it was not quick enough. Those
inside heard a deafening report; the
house was filled with smoke; the doorway
became a heap of fallen timber, and
the blackened body of a man lay groaning
among the charred ruins. One of
the robbers, their wives, and all the
children were safe. But when the
smoke cleared away, and the body by
the door was examined, life was all but
extinct. For weeks the robber hung
between life and death. It forms no
part of this story to tell what pains he
suffered, or what agonies of mind he
passed through, or how, when months
after he was able to crawl from his bed
and go out into the air it was to see
never more the sunlight or the flowers
with his sightless eyes. Certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Donald's words had come true. When
the miner heard that evening what had
happened, although he had already sent
off word to the nearest police-station
with the names of the guilty men, he
took no further action in the matter.
God's punishment was quicker than
man's.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">CHAPTER VIII</h2>


<p>Late that afternoon the monkey turned
up at his old home. Donald found him
lying at the door, an almost unrecognisable
object. Thanks to the way the
robber had carried him, one half of his
body was untouched, but the other half
was a pitiable spectacle, and the long
curly tail, Gum's great ornament and
plaything, was blown off by the root.
The poor creature had swooned, but
that he had lain there an hour or two
in great pain was plain from the way
the gravel was tossed about in all
directions round him. Donald was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
greatly touched, and lifting him up in his
arms as tenderly as if he were a child,
placed him in his own bed and dressed
his burns. After a long sleep it awoke,
and Donald, who had sat silently by his
side, bent over to allow it to lick his
face. The moment it opened its
mouth the miner sprang from his
chair as if he had been shot. For
there between his teeth the monkey
held the nugget!</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>Five years have passed. Donald is the
richest man in Silver Creek County, and
his great mines are worked by hundreds
of men. He lives in a great house,
sumptuously furnished and full of
precious things, which he delights to
show to the many visitors who flock to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
see his mine. But of all these precious
things, by far the most precious is Gum,
the monkey without a tail, 'the finder
of his first nugget, and the founder of
his fortunes,' as he says to everybody.
Then he tells how Gum found the
nugget, and how it was stolen and once
more brought back; and how when
Gum got better, the two went back to
the spot where the big lump was found,
and searched and searched, and found
lump after lump and nugget after
nugget, until, in a few months, more
gold was hidden below Donald's bed
than had come from all the mines put
together since they first were opened.
